- Default configuration is without TS
- Integration eslint + Vue is a bit buggy in VS Code (// eslint-disable-next-line)
- Methods have to be function not lambdas
- Need for a specific VSCode extension
- Need to explicitely declare `components` to be able to use them in the template
- Vue devtools does not detect Vue (sometimes when Vue fails with Vue.use(undefined))
